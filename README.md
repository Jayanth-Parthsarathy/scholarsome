## About

Scholarsome <a href="http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%CB%88sk%C3%A4l%C9%99rs(%C9%99)m%2F">(pronounced ˈskälərs(ə)m/)</a> is a web-based and open source studying system. Through the use of flashcards, among other core features, users can practice memorization of terms and definitions, along with keeping their data secure locally.

While other services have begun to paywall core functionalities, Scholarsome intends to offer an equal alternative that does not compromise on feature sets.

- Create your own study sets ✅
- Import sets from Anki and Quizlet ✅
- Study flashcards in multiple learning modes ✅
- Create quizzes using fill-in-the-blank, true/false, and multiple choice questions ✅
- Edit your sets ✅
- Change set visibility ✅

However, the service can be hosted yourself on any system. For those wishing to self-host Scholarsome, documentation for installation can be found <a href="https://docs.scholarsome.com/get-started/prerequisites">here.</a>

## Development

For development purposes, Scholarsome is required to be installed outside the standard container-based system that is used for production installs. Documentation for development can be found <a href="https://docs.scholarsome.com/development/development-guide">here.</a>
