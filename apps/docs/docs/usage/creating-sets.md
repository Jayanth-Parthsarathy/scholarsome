# Creating Sets

Sets are the core foundation of Scholarsome. Flashcards, quizzes, and everything else are all built on top of the data stored within sets.

## Creating manually

The most common way to create a set is the manual way, where each card is typed in by hand.

To create a set manually, click the purple button in the navigation bar that says "Create", and then click "Study set." This will take you to the set creation page.
