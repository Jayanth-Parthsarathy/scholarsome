# Creating Sets

Sets are the core foundation of Scholarsome. Flashcards, quizzes, and everything else are all built on top of the data stored within sets.

## Creating manually

The most common way to create a set is manually, where each card is typed in.

To create a set manually, click the purple button in the navigation bar that says "Create", and then click "Study set." This will take you to the set creation page.

In this menu, you can configure the set's title, description, visibility, and add cards. Click the purple "Create" button on the page once you are finished configuring the set.

## Importing from Anki

Most sets from Anki can be imported to Scholarsome, via a `.apkg` file. At the moment, only notes with a traditional front and back are supported. Multiple fields will be supported in a future release.  If you receive an error that your set isn't supported, then it means that your set cannot be imported currently.

You will need to export your `.apkg` file before being able to import it to Scholarsome. Within Anki, click "File", then click "Export." Change the export format to "Anki Deck Package", and select the set you want to export in the "Include" section. 

To import a set from Anki, click the purple button in the navigation bar that says "Create", and then click "From Anki."

In this menu, you can configure the set's title, description, and visibility. Below the visibility toggle, you can upload your recently exported `.apkg` file.

Click the purple "Create" button once you are ready to import the set.

## Importing from Quizlet

Sets from Quizlet can only be imported if you are the one who created them. Quizlet only provides the exporting tools for the creator of the set.

Go to your set within Quizlet, and click the three dots next to the edit pencil, near your profile picture. Click "Export." Select the "Tab" and "Semicolon" options. Then, click "Copy text."

Back in Scholarsome, click the purple button in the navigation bar that says "Create", and then click "From Quizlet."

In this menu, you can configure the set's title, description, and visibility. Below the visibility toggle, paste your copied set into the space below.

Click the purple "Create" button once you are ready to import the set.
